# Biosignals

## Early Disaster Warning System

### Project Overview

Biosignals is a web-based application designed to detect and predict natural disasters by analyzing changes in animal behavior. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the application processes data from various sources to identify anomalies in animal patterns, potentially indicating an impending disaster.
